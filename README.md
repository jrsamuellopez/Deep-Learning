# Deep Learning
Each folder contains a project that uses techniques of Deep Learning.
- There is a single neural network built from scratch to predict the bike rentals of a company.
- A convolutional neural network with transfer-learning to classify dog breeds.
- Generative adversarial neural networks that can generate artificial human faces from random inputs.
- A Deep Reinforcement Learning neural network with an actor-critic architechture, and an agent with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) able to teach a quadcopter (basically a drone) how to fly and reach a target.
